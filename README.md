# Kanban Board

## Description

The "Kanban Board" project is an interactive visual tool that allows you to manage and track the progress of tasks. Tasks are represented by cards, which are added to the "To Do" column through an input box. As tasks are started, the cards are moved to the "In Progress" column. When tasks are completed, the cards are then moved to the "Done" column. This flow allows for efficient tracking of task progress and facilitates work organization.
